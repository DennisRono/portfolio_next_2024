## 1. Understanding Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Types of Machine Learning

#### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that map inputs to known outputs.

**Key Algorithms:**

- Linear/Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Neural Networks


**Example (Decision Tree):**

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

#### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data without predefined outputs.

**Key Algorithms:**

- K-means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders


**Example (K-means):**

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(data)
```

#### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning trains agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors.

**Key Algorithms:**

# Update Q-value
Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])
```

#### Self-supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning creates supervisory signals from the data itself, enabling training without explicit labels.

**Key Approaches:**

- Masked Language Modeling
- Contrastive Learning
- Generative Modeling


**Example (Contrastive Learning):**

```python
# SimCLR loss (simplified)
def contrastive_loss(z_i, z_j, temperature=0.5):
