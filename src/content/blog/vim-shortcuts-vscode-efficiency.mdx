## Introduction

Enhancing your coding efficiency in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) can be achieved by mastering Vim shortcuts. Vim’s modal editing and powerful commands can transform how you interact with your code, making it faster and more intuitive. This blog will guide you through essential Vim shortcuts and keybindings tailored for VSCode, helping you streamline your workflow and boost productivity.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Vim shortcuts, ensure you have the following:

- **Vim Extension in VSCode:** Install the Vim extension to enable Vim keybindings and modes within VSCode.
- **Basic Understanding of Vim:** Familiarity with Vim’s fundamental concepts and shortcuts will be beneficial.
- **Visual Studio Code Interface:** Basic knowledge of VSCode’s interface and features.

## Essential Vim Shortcuts

Here is a list of essential Vim shortcuts to enhance your coding experience:

1. **`i`** - Enter Insert mode at the cursor.
2. **`I`** - Enter Insert mode at the beginning of the line.
3. **`a`** - Enter Insert mode after the cursor.
4. **`A`** - Enter Insert mode at the end of the line.
5. **`o`** - Open a new line below and enter Insert mode.
6. **`O`** - Open a new line above and enter Insert mode.

## Customizing Keybindings

**Keybindings** allow you to customize how Vim commands and shortcuts behave in VSCode. By configuring keybindings, you can tailor the editor to fit your coding style and improve your efficiency. Below is an example of a `keybindings.json` configuration to enhance your Vim experience:

### Sample `keybindings.json`

```json
[
    {
        "key": "cmd+k",
        "command": "workbench.action.nextEditor"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+j",
        "command": "workbench.action.previousEditor"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+ctrl+j",
        "command": "moveActiveEditor",
        "args": { "to": "left" }
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+ctrl+k",
        "command": "moveActiveEditor",
        "args": { "to": "right" }
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+j",
        "command": "selectNextSuggestion",
        "when": "suggestWidgetMultipleSuggestions && suggestWidgetVisible && textInputFocus"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+k",
        "command": "selectPrevSuggestion",
        "when": "suggestWidgetMultipleSuggestions && suggestWidgetVisible && textInputFocus"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+j",
        "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenSelectNext",
        "when": "inQuickOpen"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+k",
        "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenSelectPrevious",
        "when": "inQuickOpen"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+n",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.newInActiveWorkspace"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+enter",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+ctrl+enter",
        "command": "workbench.action.toggleMaximizedPanel"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+d",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.split",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+\\",
        "command": "-workbench.action.terminal.split",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+k",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focusNextPane",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported"
    },
    {
        "key": "alt+cmd+down",
        "command": "-workbench.action.terminal.focusNextPane",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+j",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focusPreviousPane",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported"
    },
    {
        "key": "alt+cmd+up",
        "command": "-workbench.action.terminal.focusPreviousPane",
        "when": "terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+w",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.kill",
        "when": "terminalFocus"
    },
    {
        "key": "tab",
        "command": "tab",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorTabMovesFocus"
    },
    {
        "key": "shift+tab",
        "command": "outdent",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorTabMovesFocus"
    }
]
```

## Enabling Tab in Read-Only Mode

To customize Vim settings in VSCode, add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:

### Sample `settings.json`

```json
{
    "vim.timeout": 200,
    "vim.useSystemClipboard": true,
    "vim.insertModeKeyBindings": [
        {
            "before": ["k", "j"],
            "after": ["<Esc>", "l"]
        }
    ],
    "vim.useCtrlKeys": true,
    "vim.handleKeys": {
        "<C-f>": true,
        "<C-a>": false
    },
    "vim.normalModeKeyBindings": [
        {
            "before": ["v", "n"],
            "after": ["v", "g", "_", "y"]
        },
        {
            "before": ["f", "d"],
            "commands": ["typescript.goToSourceDefinition"]
        },
        {
            "before": ["d", "f"],
            "after": ["g", "d"]
        },
        {
            "before": ["d", "n"],
            "after": ["d", "g", "_"]
        }
    ],
    "vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive": [
        {
            "before": ["<C-n>"],
            "commands": [":nohl"]
        }
    ],
    "vim.visualModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive": [
        {
            "before": ["p"],
            "commands": ["editor.action.clipboardPasteAction"]
        }
    ]
}
```
