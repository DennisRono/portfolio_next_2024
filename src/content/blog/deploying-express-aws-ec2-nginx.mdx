## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account
- A registered domain name
- Node.js and NPM installed locally
- Basic knowledge of SSH and the terminal

## Step 1: Setting Up Your AWS EC2 Instance

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:
    - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
    - Navigate to EC2 Dashboard and click "Launch Instance".
    - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). We recommend the latest Ubuntu Server AMI.
    - Select an instance type. The `t2.micro` is a good starting point as it is part of the free tier.
    - Configure instance details and add storage as needed.
    - Add a tag (e.g., Name: MyExpressApp).
    - Configure the security group. Allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic.
2. **Connect to Your Instance**:
    - Once your instance is running, click on "Connect".
    - Use SSH to connect to your instance:
        
        ```bash
        ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns
        ```
        

## Step 2: Setting Up Node.js on EC2

1. **Update your package lists**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
2. **Install Node.js and NPM**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
    ```
    
3. **Verify the installation**:
    
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
    

## Step 3: Deploying Your Express.js Application

1. **Transfer your application to the EC2 instance**:
    
    You can use SCP to transfer files:
    
    ```bash
    scp -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem -r /path/to/your-app ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns:/home/ubuntu
    ```
    
2. **Install dependencies and start the application**:
    
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/your-app
    npm install
    node app.js
    ```
    
    Replace `app.js` with the entry point of your application.
    

## Step 4: Setting Up NGINX as a Reverse Proxy

1. **Install NGINX**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nginx -y
    ```
    
2. **Configure NGINX**:
    - Open the default NGINX configuration file:
        
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        ```
        
    - Replace the contents with the following:
        
        ```json
        server {
            listen 80;
        
            server_name your-domain.com;
        
            location / {
                proxy_pass <http://localhost:3000>;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
            }
        }
        
        ```
        
    
    Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain and ensure your Express.js app is running on port 3000.
    
3. **Restart NGINX**:
    
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
    

## Step 5: Setting Up Your Custom Domain

1. **Configure DNS Settings**:
    - Go to your domain registrar's website and find the DNS settings.
    - Add an A record pointing to your EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP address.
2. **Verify the DNS Configuration**:
    - It might take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate. You can use tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to verify your domain points to your EC2 instance.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Your Express.js application is now deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, served by NGINX, and accessible via your custom domain. This setup not only provides a professional and scalable solution but also leverages the power of AWS for reliable hosting.
