Managing an avocado farm is a complex task involving multiple activities such as tree health monitoring, irrigation scheduling, harvest management, inventory control, and expense tracking. These processes are often managed using spreadsheets or paper records, which can be inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors.

To tackle these issues, I developed a **Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Avocado Farm Management System** to streamline operations and improve productivity. This blog post will walk you through the project, its features, and how it works.

## Problem Statement

Farmers often face inefficiencies in managing farm operations due to manual processes. These inefficiencies can lead to errors in tracking tree health, irrigation schedules, harvest plans, and expenses, ultimately affecting productivity and profitability. The **Avocado Farm Management System CLI** provides a solution by digitizing farm management tasks and offering a streamlined way to track important metrics, reduce errors, and optimize farm operations.

---

## Solution Overview

The **Avocado Farm Management System CLI** is a lightweight command-line-based solution that assists avocado farmers in efficiently managing key farm activities, such as:

- Tree health monitoring
- Irrigation management
- Harvest planning
- Inventory tracking
- Sales and distribution management
- Farm expense tracking
- Reports and analytics generation

It provides an easy-to-use interface with text-based commands, allowing farmers to log and retrieve information, generate reports, and make data-driven decisions.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Tree Health Monitoring**

This feature helps farmers monitor the health of each avocado tree by:

- Recording growth stages (e.g., tree height, leaf health, and age)
- Logging pest control activities and fertilization schedules
- Keeping track of tree productivity and any adverse reactions

### 2. **Irrigation Management**

Farmers can manage irrigation schedules based on tree requirements, soil moisture, and weather conditions. They can:

- Set up irrigation schedules
- Record water usage, duration, and method of application
- Track deviations from the irrigation plan

### 3. **Harvest Planning & Management**

This feature allows farmers to plan and manage harvest activities, such as:

- Documenting projected harvest dates based on tree maturity and weather conditions
- Recording harvested quantities and identifying individual tree contributions

### 4. **Inventory Management**

The system enables farmers to track the post-harvest inventory by:

- Logging the size, quality, and any defects of harvested avocados
- Managing storage conditions and tracking spoilage or distribution status

### 5. **Sales and Distribution Tracking**

Farmers can track their avocado sales and distribution efforts by:

- Logging sales orders and customer details
- Tracking shipment and analyzing sales performance (total revenue, order volume, customer trends)

### 6. **Farm Expense Tracking**

This feature helps farmers record and analyze their expenses:

- Logging various expenses, such as labor, materials, and equipment costs
- Generating expense reports to identify cost-saving opportunities

### 7. **Reports and Analytics**

The CLI generates reports that help farmers understand their farmâ€™s performance. Reports include:

- Farm productivity and sales performance
- Expense summaries with text-based graphs and tables for analysis

### 8. **Weather Data Integration**

The system can integrate weather data to help farmers make informed decisions about irrigation and harvest planning.

## Installation and Setup

To run the **Avocado Farm Management System CLI** on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DennisRono/avocado_farm_cli_management_system.git
   cd avocado_farm_cli_management_system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   This project uses Python. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required packages using `pipenv`:

   ```bash
   mkdir .venv && pipenv shell && pipenv install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   Launch the CLI application with the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## How It Works

Once the application is up and running, users can interact with a text-based menu system to perform various farm management tasks. For example:

### Main Menu

```text
1. Manage Trees (Add and Varieties)
2. Tree Health Monitoring
3. Irrigation Management
4. Harvest Planning & Management
5. Inventory Management
6. Sales and Distribution Tracking
7. Farm Expense Tracking
8. Reports and Analytics
9. Weather Data Integration
10. Exit
```

### Tree Health Monitoring

Users can log tree health metrics such as tree height, age, leaf health, and pest infestation data. The data is stored in a local SQLite database for future reference and reporting.

### Irrigation Management

The system allows farmers to schedule and record irrigation activities. Water usage and irrigation duration are tracked to ensure optimal resource utilization.

### Harvest and Inventory Management

The CLI helps farmers keep track of the harvest schedule, including projected harvest dates and quantities. Harvested avocados are then logged into an inventory management system, where their quality and storage conditions can be monitored.

### Expense Tracking and Reports

Farmers can track their expenses in different categories, generate reports, and analyze trends in costs, helping them make informed financial decisions.

## Sample Code

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of how some key functionalities are implemented in the system:

### Main Menu Logic (in `main.py`)

```python
def main_menu():
    options = [
        "1. Manage Trees (Add and Varieties)",
        "2. Tree Health Monitoring",
        "3. Irrigation Management",
        "4. Harvest Planning & Management",
        "5. Inventory Management",
        "6. Sales and Distribution Tracking",
        "7. Farm Expense Tracking",
        "8. Reports and Analytics",
        "9. Weather Data Integration",
        "10. Exit",
    ]
    print("\n".join(options))


def main():
    while True:
        main_menu()
        choice = input(">> ")

        if choice == "1":
            manage_trees()
        elif choice == "2":
            monitor_tree_health()
        # Other options go here...
        elif choice == "10":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Try again.")
```

### Database Models (in `initialize_db.py`)

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float, Date
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Tree(Base):
    __tablename__ = "trees"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    variety = Column(String)
    height = Column(Float)
    leaf_health = Column(String)
    age = Column(Integer)

class Harvest(Base):
    __tablename__ = "harvest"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    tree_id = Column(Integer)
    quantity = Column(Float)
    date = Column(Date)
```
