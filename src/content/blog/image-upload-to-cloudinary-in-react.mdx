At some point in your application, you'll have to handle images whether it be for profile pictures, blog posts, or any other need. You'll need the images hosted somewhere and served to your application. There are many ways you can handle image uploads, from bare metal where you upload the images to your custom server, to using a third-party service.

## Different Image Hosting Providers

There are several image hosting providers you can use:

1. **Cloudinary**
2. **Imgur**
3. **Amazon S3**
4. **Firebase Storage**
5. **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage**

### Cloudinary

Cloudinary is a comprehensive cloud-based service for managing images and videos. It offers powerful tools for upload, storage, manipulation, and delivery, all optimized for web performance.

### Imgur

Imgur is a popular image hosting service primarily known for hosting images shared on social media and online forums. It's user-friendly and free for most uses.

### Amazon S3

Amazon S3 is a scalable storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is commonly used for storing and retrieving any amount of data, including images.

### Firebase Storage

Firebase Storage is a part of Google’s Firebase suite. It allows you to store and serve user-generated content, such as photos and videos.

### Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. It is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Third-Party Services

### Advantages

- **Scalability**: Third-party services handle scaling automatically, ensuring your application can handle a growing number of images without additional setup.
- **Reliability**: These services often come with high uptime guarantees and data redundancy.

## Integrating Cloudinary with React

To integrate Cloudinary with a React application, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Cloudinary SDK

First, you need to install the Cloudinary SDK in your React project:

```tsx
npm i cloudinary
```

create a configuration file for your environment files

`config/cloudinary.ts`

```tsx
import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary'

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
})

export { cloudinary }
```

Don’t forget to have your Environment variables set otherwise the upload will not work! You can get the details from Cloudinary website

```tsx
# cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=''
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=''
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=''
REACT_APP_UPLOAD_PRESET=''
```

Lets now write some server side logic to handle uploading the image files to Cloudinary servers

in our application lets create a file 

`src/app/api/upload/route.ts`

```tsx
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { uploadToCloudinary } from '@/utils/upload'

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const formData = await req.formData()
  const file = formData.get('file') as File
  const folder = formData.get('user_id') as string

  const fileBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer()

  const mimeType = file.type
  const encoding = 'base64'
  const base64Data = Buffer.from(fileBuffer).toString('base64')

  // this will be used to upload the file
  const fileUri = 'data:' + mimeType + ';' + encoding + ',' + base64Data

  const res = await uploadToCloudinary(fileUri, file.name, folder)

  if (res.success && res.result) {
    return NextResponse.json({
      message: 'success',
      imgUrl: res.result.secure_url,
    })
  } else return NextResponse.json({ message: 'failure' })
}
```

lets also have a helper function to send `POST` request to Cloudinary and also to handle Folder structure of our uploaded images

`utils/upload.ts`

```tsx
import { cloudinary } from '@/config/cloudinary'
import { UploadApiErrorResponse, UploadApiResponse } from 'cloudinary'

type UploadResponse =
  | { success: true; result?: UploadApiResponse }
  | { success: false; error: UploadApiErrorResponse }

export const uploadToCloudinary = async (
  fileUri: string,
  fileName: string,
  folder: string
): Promise<UploadResponse> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    cloudinary.uploader
      .upload(fileUri, {
        invalidate: true,
        resource_type: 'auto',
        filename_override: fileName,
        folder: 'nullcommerce/' + folder, // you can specifu which folders you want the images to be saved in here
        use_filename: true,
        eager: [
          {
            transformation: [
              { width: 800, height: 800, crop: 'fit' },
              {
                color: 'E1D6FF87',
                overlay: 'text:roboto_18_bold_normal_left:nullchemy shop',
                gravity: 'center',
                x: 50,
                y: -20,
                flags: 'layer_apply',
              },
            ],
            format: 'webp',
          },
        ],
      })
      .then((result: any) => {
        resolve({ success: true, result })
      })
      .catch((error: any) => {
        reject({ success: false, error })
      })
  })
}
```

Now that we have an endpoint to hit, lets create a function to be handling sending requests to the server

`utils/ImageUpload.ts`

```tsx
'use client'
const ImageUpload = async (file: File | null, user_id: string) => {
  if (file) {
    try {
      const form = new FormData()
      form.set('file', file)
      form.set('user_id', user_id)
      const res = await fetch('/api/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: form,
        headers: {},
      })

      const data = await res.json()

      return data.imgUrl
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error uploading image:', error)
      return null
    }
  } else {
    console.log('No File')
    return null
  }
}

export default ImageUpload
```

Finally lets create an interface to allow user to be able to select files to be uploaded. In this example once the image will be selected it will start uploading immediately and returning the live URL to be saved in a database

`FileUpload.tsx`

```tsx
'use client'
import ImageUpload from '@/utils/ImageUpload'
import { useCallback, Key, useState } from 'react'
import { useDropzone, Accept, FileRejection } from 'react-dropzone'
import { toast } from 'react-toastify'

const FileRejectionToast = ({ file, errors }: any) => (
  <div>
    <div>{`${file.name} - ${(file.size / 1e6).toFixed(2)} Mb`}</div>
    <ul>
      {errors.map((e: any) => (
        <li key={e.code}>{e.message}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>
)

const FileUpload = ({ formData, setFormData }: FileUploadType) => {
  const user_id = 'Your User ID Here' // when a user is logged the user_id is passed to here

  const onDrop = useCallback(
    async (acceptedFiles: File[], fileRejections: FileRejection[]) => {
      const uploadFiles = async (): Promise<void> => {
        const paths: string[] | null = []
        for (const file of acceptedFiles) {
          try {
            const url = await ImageUpload(file, user_id)
            if (url) {
              paths.push(url)
            }
          } catch (error: any) {
            toast.error(`Error uploading ${file.name}: ${error.message}`)
          }
        }
        setFormData({ ...formData, images: [...formData.images, ...paths] })
      }

      await uploadFiles()

      fileRejections.forEach(({ file, errors }) => {
        toast.error(<FileRejectionToast file={file} errors={errors} />)
      })
    },
    [formData, setFormData]
  )

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      'image/jpeg': ['.jpg', '.jpeg'],
      'image/png': ['.png'],
      'image/gif': ['.gif'],
    } as Accept,
    multiple: true,
    maxFiles: 20,
    maxSize: 1e8,
    minSize: 100,
  })

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-4 bg-gray-100 border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 rounded-lg">
      <div
        {...getRootProps()}
        className={`w-full p-4 text-center cursor-pointer ${
          isDragActive ? 'bg-gray-200' : 'bg-gray-100'
        }`}
      >
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        <p className="text-gray-500">
          {isDragActive
            ? 'Drop the files here ...'
            : 'Drag & drop files here, or click to select files'}
        </p>
      </div>
      {Array.isArray(formData.images) && formData.images.length > 0 && (
        <ul className="mt-4 w-full flex items-center justify-start flex-wrap gap-2">
          {formData.images.map((file: string, i: Key | null | undefined) => (
            <li
              key={i}
              className={`w-min cursor-pointer text-center p-2 bg-white rounded shadow-sm mb-2`}
            >
              <div className="">
                <div className="max-h-[100px] w-[100px]">
                  {/*eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element*/}
                  <img src={file} alt="" className="object-cover" />
                </div>
              </div>
              <button
                className="ml-2 text-red-500 hover:text-red-700"
                onClick={() => {
                  setFormData({
                    ...formData,
                    images: formData.images.filter(
                      (_: any, imgIndex: any) => imgIndex !== i
                    ),
                  })
                }}
              >
                Remove
              </button>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default FileUpload

```

This will allow drag and drop of images and an interface to interact with.

Example Usage `MyForm.tsx`

```tsx
'use client'
import React, { FormEvent, useState } from 'react'
import FileUpload from '@/components/FileUpload'
import { toast } from 'react-toastify'

const MyForm = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<Form>({
    full_name: '',
    email: '',
    address: '',
    city: '',
    country_region: '',
    state_province: '',
    zip_code: '',
    images: [],
  })

  const handleSubmit = async (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    toast('Edit MyForm Handle Submit To Submit the Form to the server!', {
      type: 'success',
    })
  }

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-full">
      <div className="p-2 h-full w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-mono font-bold text-center mt-14">
          Image Upload To Cloudinary v2
        </h1>
        <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full flex-1">
          <div className="w-[90%] mx-auto sm:w-[500px]">
            <form className="w-full" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
              <div className="lg:col-span-2">
                <FileUpload formData={formData} setFormData={setFormData} />
                <div className="md:col-span-5 text-right">
                  <div className="inline-flex items-end">
                    <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
                      Submit
                    </button>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </form>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyForm

```
